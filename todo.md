# Plan
1. Sort out the website layout on paper
2. Sort out all the divs in `index.html`
3. Do validation CSS after steps 1 and 2

# Tips
1. There's a div behind the Odin logo that is slightly transparent to help visibility
2. In terms of colours... The other variation is the selected input, which should have a blue border and subtle box-shadow. This can be done with the :focus pseudo-class you've learned about in an earlier lesson.
